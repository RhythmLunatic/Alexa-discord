# Alexa-discord
This is the most pointless Discord bot ever.

When you type "Alexa, play" or "Alexa play", it will immediately link a YouTube video in the channel.

## Setup
First add your discord bot token and google api token to config.json.
Then...
```bash
npm install discord.js
npm install snekfetch
node alexa.js
```
Enjoy.
